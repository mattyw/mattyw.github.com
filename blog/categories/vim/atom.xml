    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&rsquo;t normally find programming koans enlightening or amusing, there is one execption &ndash; which pretty much sums up my approach to vim:</p>

<p>```
Master Wq and the Markdown acolyte</p>

<p>A Markdown acolyte came to Master Wq to demonstrate his Vim plugin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have nearly finished the Vim macros that translate Markdown into HTML.
My functions interweave, my parser is a paragon of efficiency, and the results nearly flawless.
I daresay I have mastered Vimscript, and my work will validate Vim as a modern editor for the enlightened developer!
Have I done rightly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Wq read the acolyte&rsquo;s code for several minutes without saying anything. Then he opened a Markdown document, and typed:</p>

<p>:%!markdown
HTML filled the buffer instantly. The acolyte began to cry.
```</p>

<p>But I was starting to get the feeling that most vim users had loads of plugins installed &ndash; so I decided I wanted to find out if this was true.</p>

<p>20 minutes later I had hacked my way through a basic survey &ndash; which was full of holes and typos. Despite this I had over 1000 responses in 24 hours &ndash; which gives us our first &lsquo;statistic&rsquo;:</p>

<p><code>
Vim users love talking about vim
</code></p>

<p>So, here are the results. 1300 of you responded to the survey. Percentages have been rounded down to the nearest integer. Because I said so. Questions where the answers were freeform I&rsquo;ve done my best to group. But it might not be perfect.
Each question was optional so each question had a number of empty responses, I&rsquo;ve left these out. This is why most percentages do not add up to 100%</p>

<p>I welcome others to take a look at the raw results: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AutYm8I1SyjZdGh5V0w2ZE5FZzZMT2NYVWY5bVJkWFE&amp;usp=sharing">Link to Raw Data</a></p>

<h3>Give me a single piece of advice</h3>

<p>Some of it is great, some is crazy, you&rsquo;re welcome to take a look at the raw results:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cUmvNqsWgkqEEOvX5K7RMxuEvu1EZTtOKo0V1YDXguw/edit">It&rsquo;s all here</a></p>

<h3>Your view of emacs?</h3>

<p>never used emacs &ndash; don&rsquo;t want to 498 38%</p>

<p>never used emacs &ndash; but willing to try 418 32%</p>

<p>i use it every now and again 221 17%</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s another tool in my toolbox 113 8%</p>

<p>I spent a while trying to work out how to construct this question, what I was trying to work out is if the editor war really existed, I don&rsquo;t use emacs, but I did, and there are some things I think it does better than vim, and some things it doesn&rsquo;t.
I spent ~2 years using emacs before moving to vim, I wanted to get a broad idea of how emacs is view by the vim community. The results were a suprise</p>

<h1>That&rsquo;s it</h1>

<p>That&rsquo;s all there is nothing more. I&rsquo;m not great with statistics so I encourage others to take a look at the raw data and come up with a much better &lsquo;analysis&rsquo;.
If anyone feels that the above is in some way worthy of a small tip here&rsquo;s my btc address:</p>
