    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://blog.mattyw.net/blog/2015/10/18/snappy-juju-flasher-video/">previously</a> shown juju running on a raspberry pi 2, albeit deploying
servers in ec2. Recently the lxd project <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/">released a snap</a> that can be used
to install lxd on ubuntu snappy, it even works on a raspberry pi 2.
Around the same time lxd provider support landed in the master branch of juju.
Naturally I thought it would be cool if I could use juju to spin up some units using lxd
on my raspberry pi 2.</p>

<p>The following video shows it in action:</p>

<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s slow and unofficial, but it&rsquo;s fun. For the curious these were the steps involved in getting this working.</p>

<ul>
<li>Juju was compiled using a raspbian image and <a href="http://dave.cheney.net/unofficial-arm-tarballs">Dave Cheney&rsquo;s arm release of go</a>.</li>
<li>I needed to turn video memory right down and the available swap space up to 1GB, my sd card will not be happy.</li>
<li>The compiled binaries were copied to my laptop where I built the juju snap and uploaded it to the raspberry pi 2 running ubuntu snappy.</li>
<li>Juju wasn&rsquo;t able to access the unix socket lxd was using. So lxd was configured to work remotely, and juju was using it remotely (they just happened to be running on the same host)</li>
<li>Some of juju&rsquo;s upstart scripts set extra limits on allowable open files and processes. upstart wouldn&rsquo;t start these services as they were beyond what was allowed. I removed these from the
upstart file, which isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;d want to do normally.</li>
</ul>


<p>Not exactly production ready stuff, but playing is fun.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to share a proof of concept project I&rsquo;ve been working on that combines
the worlds of ubuntu snappy and juju.</p>

<p>I wanted to use the flashing leds on the raspberry pi 2&rsquo;s piglow to tell me the
status of my cloud services. The idea being that if there&rsquo;s something I need to fix
the flashing leds will tell me, without me having to keep checking my phone or laptop
to get updates.</p>

<p>This demo will use the <a href="https://jujucharms.com/realtime-syslog-analytics/">realtime syslog analytics</a>
big data bundle as my example environment. It&rsquo;s deployed in ec2 but it&rsquo;s controlled and managed
by juju running on my raspberry pi. I&rsquo;m going to show you a working environment with happy led status.
Then I&rsquo;m going to cause some trouble and we&rsquo;ll see the leds change to unhappy.</p>

<p>The idea being that if I want to know the status of my cloud services I only need to glance at my
raspberry pi for a moment.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still some work to be done around optimising the various led patterns. There could be a way
that I could convey seriousness of the problem via the leds, or even how long there has been a problem.
That&rsquo;s work that can come later.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Using a Raspberry Pi 2 with Ubuntu Snappy installed we&rsquo;re going to write a
simple snap that will flash a piglow attached to the gpio pins.</p>

<p>If you want to skip these steps you can download the snap itself from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2o298qugyts0r3o/hello-piglow_1.0.0_all.snap?dl=0">here</a></p>

<h2>1. A simple piglow flashing binary</h2>

<p>To make things simple we&rsquo;ll use go to produce a simple binary that will
flash the legs of the piglow. We&rsquo;re using go because the static compilation means
our snap will have no dependencies to deal with. The code itself is small.
<a href="https://github.com/mattyw/flasher">https://github.com/mattyw/flasher</a>
I modified the piglow library I was using to get a bit more feedback about piglow
errors, the change is trivial to revert should you need to.</p>

<h2>2. Create the snap</h2>

<p>The package structure is simple</p>

<p>```bash
├── bin
│   └── flasher
└── meta</p>

<pre><code>├── package.yaml
└── readme.md
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>flasher is the binary I produced in step 1. The package.yaml just contains
information about the snap:</p>

<p><code>yaml
name: hello-piglow
version: 1.0.0
vendor: me
binaries:
 - name: bin/flasher
</code>
Once you&rsquo;ve got all this in place build it and send it over to your pi.</p>

<p><code>bash
snappy build .                                                                  
snappy-remote --url=ssh://&lt;ip-address&gt;:22 install &lt;snap-name&gt;
</code></p>

<h2>3. On the Pi</h2>

<p>You need to give your snap permission to access the i2c device</p>

<p><code>bash
sudo snappy hw-assign hello-piglow.sideload /dev/i2c-1
</code></p>

<h2>4. You&rsquo;re done</h2>

<p><code>bash
sudo hello-piglow.flasher
</code></p>

<p>If all goes well you should have a flashing piglow</p>
