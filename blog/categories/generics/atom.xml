    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this blog post I attempt to connect monads in haskell with generics in go, avoiding flame wars as I go.
If I&rsquo;ve made mistakes please let me know and I&rsquo;ll gladly fix them.</p>

<h2>The Thought</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished listening to episode 10 of the <a href="http://bikeshed.fm/10">bikeshed</a> which is
largely a discussion about haskell, and well worth a listen to. However the conversation that starts
at around 29:40 is what triggered this thought.</p>

<h2>Haskell without monads</h2>

<p>If you want to do IO in Haskell you need to use monads. But it&rsquo;s possible to write a number of programs without IO(1).</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/history.pdf">&ldquo;A history of haskell, being lazy with class&rdquo;</a> 6 years passed between the first
release of haskell, and monadic IO being introduced.
Why so long?</p>

<p><strong>The language designers were under no pressure, they had time to think about how IO should be dealt with in the language.</strong></p>

<h2>The question of Go Generics</h2>

<p>Go doesn&rsquo;t support generics, and it&rsquo;s often cited as a big downside or even a failing of the language. However you can still write very useful programs in go
without generics(1). But here&rsquo;s the thing:</p>

<p><strong>The language designers are under no pressure, they have time to think about how generics should be dealt with in the language.</strong></p>

<p>This is important. Just because a language doesn&rsquo;t do something now, doesn&rsquo;t mean it never will.
If you&rsquo;ve not taken a look at go previously because you&rsquo;ve been swayed by the &ldquo;no generics&rdquo; argument I recomend taking a look at go again.</p>
