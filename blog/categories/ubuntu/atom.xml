    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>tl;dr: <a href="http://juju.ubuntu.com">Juju</a> is aimed at deploying and scaling hundreds of services. But it&rsquo;s also a handy alternative to buying a VPS.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a VPS, I have in the past but I&rsquo;ve never used them enough for me to be able to justify the cost long term.
Juju provides a perfect solution to this use case.</p>

<p>I have a very simple charm I call <a href="https://github.com/mattyw/charm_collection/tree/master/charms/precise/devenv">devenv</a>, it doesn&rsquo;t do much more than install stuff I use for doing development, like installing tmux and grabbing my configuration files. I&rsquo;ve blogged about it previously <a href="http://mattyjwilliams.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/deploying-development-machine-with-juju.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>This week I was having trouble getting a client library to connect to a simple server program I&rsquo;d written, I was lost with debugging but luckily the library author volunteered to help me out.
I already had a binary of the server that could be used to generate the error in the client library, but I don&rsquo;t have a VPS, so what&rsquo;s the quickest way for me to make the server public so the library author can play around with it?</p>

<p><a href="http://juju.ubuntu.com">Juju!</a></p>

<p>All I needed to do was to add the following line to the start hook of my devenv charm:</p>

<p><code>bash
./app &amp;
</code></p>

<p>And copy the app binary to my charm directory.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sort of an anti pattern &ndash; but because juju copies the whole charm dir when it deploys, it will grab any binaries in the charm dir as well, it&rsquo;s not a great idea to make use of this for serious deployments, but for me it was great</p>

<p>With that done all I had to do was deploy it:
<code>bash
juju bootstrap
juju deploy --repository=charms local:precise/devenv
</code></p>

<p>From deciding I wanted to deploy the binary &ndash; to having it deployed was under 5 minutes. 20 minutes later the library was fixed and the server was taken down
<code>bash
juju destroy-environment
</code></p>

<p>That was it. All in all it cost around $0.02 (that&rsquo;s just over 1p). Much better than having a VPS that would largely sit idle.</p>

<p>Of course the other advantage with using juju is that I&rsquo;m not tied to a particular cloud provider, so I can choose which one I want depending on the pricing at that moment. And since juju now supports local mode you can do your charm development offline to save even more money!</p>

<p><strong>Great, how does this help me?</strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking of getting a VPS &ndash; but don&rsquo;t feel you can justify the cost because of the amount of use you&rsquo;d get out of it, then you really should try out juju. Once you&rsquo;ve got it installed there&rsquo;s a handy charm that just deploys ubuntu server, it&rsquo;s a great starting point for writing a charm to setup your own development environment.
<code>bash
juju deploy ubuntu
</code></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another link to my post about writing a charm to build a development machine: <a href="http://mattyjwilliams.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/deploying-development-machine-with-juju.html">http://mattyjwilliams.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/deploying-development-machine-with-juju.html</a></p>
